# Fork of Legalmattic 
## Democratizing WordPress and other Business Agreements

### What is this?
This is the source of several "legal documents" on WordPress.com, including the Terms of Service. We'd like our legal documents to embody our vision of the spirit of the web--open and accessible. In addition to Legal documents from Automattic, I have added standard business templates used in legal contracts between vendors, service providers, employees and potential partners. 

### What can I do with it?
Since these documents are licensed under a Creative Commons license (see below for more information), please feel free to re-use and edit these terms to fit your own use. We do ask for a link back so we can help share the source of this license and spread the word further.
